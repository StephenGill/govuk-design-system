{% from "_example.njk" import example %}

Help the user navigate a series of pages like search results or guides.

{{ example({group: "components", item: "pagination", example: "default", html: true, nunjucks: true }) }}

## When to use this component

Use this component when you need to present content, such as guidance or search results, across multiple pages.

You might do this when:
- showing all the content on a single page makes the page take too long to load
- the user may benefit from bookmarking or linking to specific pages of the content
- most users will only need the content on the first few pages

## When not to use this component

Only break up content into pages if it makes your service faster or easier to use.

Avoid using the 'infinite scroll' technique to automatically load content when the user approaches the bottom of the page. This causes problems for keyboard users.

## How it works

Add the pagination component after the content on each page that you have broken up.

[View an example of Pagination in a standard GOV.UK page template](in-page/index.html).

### For pages in a sequence

For pages the user would usually navigate page by page, only show the previous and next links. Stack them vertically, like this:

{{ example({group: "components", item: "pagination", example: "labels", html: true, nunjucks: true }) }}

#### Add link labels to describe pages

You can use the link labels to give more context.

{{ example({group: "components", item: "pagination", example: "labels-2", html: true, nunjucks: true }) }}

### For pages in a list

For pages where the user might need to jump back and forth, add numbered page links, as well as the previous and next links, like this:

{{ example({group: "components", item: "pagination", example: "default", html: true, nunjucks: true, titleSuffix: "second" }) }}

Show the page number in the page title so the user can see it in browser tabs and bookmarks. For example 'Search results (page 1 of 4)'.

Do not show pagination if there's only one page of content.

Redirect the user to the first page if they enter a URL of a page that no longer exists.

#### Previous and next links

Previous and next links are labelled 'Previous page' and 'Next page'. You can
visually hide the word 'page' to save horizontal space.

{{ example({group: "components", item: "pagination", example: "default", html: true, nunjucks: true, titleSuffix: "third" }) }}

#### Customise link titles

You can use custom text for previous and next links, if they're more appropriate and help add context.

{{ example({group: "components", item: "pagination", example: "custom-link-text", html: true, nunjucks: true }) }}

#### First and last pages

Do not show the previous page link on the first page — and do not show the next page link on the last page.

{{ example({group: "components", item: "pagination", example: "first-page", html: true, nunjucks: true }) }}

{{ example({group: "components", item: "pagination", example: "last-page", html: true, nunjucks: true }) }}

### For large numbers of pages

Depending on the screen size, show an appropriate number of pages to fit the horizontal space available.

{{ example({group: "components", item: "pagination", example: "ellipses", html: true, nunjucks: true }) }}

For smaller screens, show page numbers for:
- the current page
- previous and next pages
- first and last pages

For larger screens, show page numbers for:
- the current page
- at least one page immediately before and after the current page 
- first and last pages

Use ellipses (…) to replace any skipped pages.

For example:
- **[1]** 2 … 100
- 1 **[2]** 3 … 100
- 1 2 **[3]** 4 … 100
- 1 2 3 **[4]** 5 … 100
- 1 … 4 **[5]** 6 … 100
- 1 … 97 **[98]** 99 100
- 1 … 98 **[99]** 100
- 1 … 99 **[100]**

### Filtering and sorting lists

If the user filters or sorts the list, apply their choice to the whole list, and not just the current page. Also redirect them back to the first page of the new results.

Set the number of items per page and the sorting algorithm so that most users find what they need on the first page.

## Research on this component

This component is based on similar ones developed and used successfully by the Government Digital Service, Ministry of Justice and the Home Office, and on feedback in the Design System backlog.
